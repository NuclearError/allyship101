@title[What is an ally?]

### What is an ally?  
A person demonstrating active, explicit, and meaningful support for marginalised and/or vulnerable groups

Note:

- Different from just being 'nice'
- It's about positive action, not ABSENCE of NEGATIVE
- "Not racist" is not the same --> absence
- Support, solidarity, sharing the burden
- Doing small things to balance out unfairness

---

@title[What is a marginalised group?]

### What is a marginalised group or individual?   
Someone who is placed at a disadvantage in society, because of who they are

Note:

- I'm going to mostly talk about the UK

Examples:
- People of colour experience racism
- women experience sexism or misogyny
- LGBTQ people experience homophobia, transphobia, etc

Other examples (less discussed):
- Age-based discrimination
- Class-based / economic status discrimination
- Disability / chronic illness
- Education level
- Mental health (eg. schizophrenia)
- Neurodivergence (eg. autism spectrum)

INTRO NEXT SLIDE ...
- A common thing you might hear
- Why do we need all this political correctness?
- Why do we need all these new words for things?
- Can't we all just use our common sense?

WHAT IF THERE WAS A SIMPLE RULE FOR DEALING WITH OTHER PEOPLE

---

# Don't be a dick
### Wheaton's Law

[wheatonslaw.com](http://www.wheatonslaw.com/)

Note:

- Wheaton's Law created by Wil Wheaton (Star Trek)
- originally introduced as a simple etiquette guide for online gamers

Why can't we all just follow this rule?
We don't need to talk about allies and marginalisation, right?

## I Think You’ll Find It’s a Bit More Complicated Than That
### Ben Goldacre

Note:

- I'm sure you're already aware
- Life is a lot more complicated than that
- If everyone had the same perception of what is acceptable behaviour, it would be really easy
- Injustice and discrimination doesn't necessarily happen just because someone woke up and decided to "be a dick"

INTRO NEXT SLIDE
Before going into what it means to be an ally, I'm going to talk about some KEY CONCEPTS. The first one is INTERSECTIONALITY

---

@title[What is intersectionality?]

# What is intersectionality?  

# 👩🏼   👴🏾   🧑🏻   👩🏿   👩🏽‍🦲

Note:

- coined by Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw in 1989
- often called "intersectional feminism"

Everyone occupies different social and cultural SPACES OR VECTORS based on their differences (eg. age, gender, race)

* Societal disadvantages (oppression)
* Societal advantages (privilege)

KEY THING is that individuals can occupy MULTIPLE VECTORS at once.

* Possible to face oppression from multiple angles at once.
* Possible to occupy PRIVILEGED SPACES and OPPRESSED SPACES simultaneously.

How society treats you is based on these social vectors.

* Krenshaw wrote about how white feminist discourse failed to adequately address this
* eg. in the case of African American women --> Racism and Misogyny

In the interest of staying in my lane, myself as an example:

* Many privileges: White, Education, Economic Status, Age
* Some disadvantages: LGBT (Bi person), Working Class, Chronic mental health (Bipolar), Neurodivergent (Autism Spectrum)
