@title[What is intersectionality?]

@snap[north span-100]
#### What is intersectionality?  
Everyone occupies different social and cultural 'spaces' (vectors) based on their differences, eg. age, race, class, gender, education etc.

Some types of difference will lead to societal disadvantages (**oppression**)

Some differences will lead to societal advantages (**privilege**)

@title[Privilege]

@snap[north span-100]
#### Privilege 

* is the other side of oppression
* doesn't mean 'bad': it's not a comment on you as a person
* can be invisible: it is easy to be unaware of your own privileges

@title[Oppression]

@snap[north span-100]
#### Oppression 

* is systemic rather than personal
* can be hard to see: it might be well hidden, or so ubiquitous that it seems 'normal'
* is made up of both macro- and micro- aggressions

@title[What is a microaggression?]

@snap[north span-100]
#### What is a microaggression?

Brief, commonplace indignities or insults - intentional or otherwise.

Small, subtle ways that a person is excluded or 'othered'.

Implied value judgements in everyday conversation that invalidate a person's existence or life choices.

@title[Intersectionality and allyship]

@snap[north span-90]
#### How does intersectionality, privilege, and oppression, relate to being an ally? 

A person can be both privileged and oppressed at the same time, in different ways

Belonging to an oppressed group does not make an individual incapable of oppressing others

**Being aware of privilege and oppression vectors in yourself and those around you is necessary to function as an ally**
