@title[What is an ally?]

### What is an ally?  
A person demonstrating active, explicit, and meaningful support for marginalised and/or vulnerable groups

Note:

- Different from just being 'nice'
- It's about positive action, not ABSENCE of NEGATIVE
- "Not racist" is not the same --> absence
- Support, solidarity, sharing the burden
- Doing small things to balance out unfairness

---

@title[What is a marginalised group?]

### What is a marginalised group or individual?   
Someone who is placed at a disadvantage in society, because of who they are

Note:

- I'm going to mostly talk about the UK

Examples:
- People of colour experience racism
- women experience sexism or misogyny
- LGBTQ people experience homophobia, transphobia, etc

Other examples (less discussed):
- Age-based discrimination
- Class-based / economic status discrimination
- Disability / chronic illness
- Education level
- Mental health (eg. schizophrenia)
- Neurodivergence (eg. autism spectrum)

INTRO NEXT SLIDE ...
- A common thing you might hear
- Why do we need all this political correctness?
- Why do we need all these new words for things?
- Can't we all just use our common sense?

WHAT IF THERE WAS A SIMPLE RULE FOR DEALING WITH OTHER PEOPLE

---

# Don't be a dick
### Wheaton's Law

[wheatonslaw.com](http://www.wheatonslaw.com/)

Note:

- Wheaton's Law created by Wil Wheaton (Star Trek)
- originally introduced as a simple etiquette guide for online gamers

Why can't we all just follow this rule?

We don't need to talk about allies and marginalisation, right?

## I Think You’ll Find It’s a Bit More Complicated Than That
### Ben Goldacre

Note:

- I'm sure you're already aware
- Life is a lot more complicated than that
- If everyone had the same perception of what is acceptable behaviour, it would be really easy
- most people see themselves as 'good' or 'right'
- Injustice and discrimination doesn't necessarily happen just because someone woke up and decided to "be a dick"

INTRO NEXT SLIDE
Before going into what it means to be an ally, I'm going to talk about some KEY CONCEPTS. The first one is INTERSECTIONALITY

---

@title[What is intersectionality?]

# What is intersectionality?  

# 👩🏼   👴🏾   🧑🏻   👩🏿   👩🏽‍🦲

Note:

- coined by Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw in 1989
- often called "intersectional feminism"

Everyone occupies different social and cultural SPACES OR VECTORS based on their differences (eg. age, gender, race)

* Societal disadvantages (oppression)
* Societal advantages (privilege)

KEY THING is that individuals can occupy MULTIPLE VECTORS at once.

* Possible to face oppression from multiple angles at once.
* Possible to occupy PRIVILEGED SPACES and OPPRESSED SPACES simultaneously.

How society treats you is based on these social vectors.

* Krenshaw wrote about how white feminist discourse failed to adequately address this
* eg. in the case of African American women --> Racism and Misogyny

In the interest of staying in my lane, myself as an example:

* Many privileges: White, Education, Economic Status, Age
* Some disadvantages: LGBT (Bi person), Working Class, Chronic mental health (Bipolar), Neurodivergent (Autism Spectrum)

INTRO NEXT SLIDE
Key things to know about privilege and oppression as concepts

---

@title[Privilege]

# Privilege 👑

Note:

- doesn't mean 'bad': it's not a comment on you as a person
- it's about how you're perceived or treated by society
- it's a passive thing, something you just are, not something you're doing
- can be invisible: it is easy to be unaware of your own privileges

EXAMPLE
- I have had a few very positive experiences with police officers in the UK and the US
- I was treated so politely and kindly, I was genuinely confused by criticism of the police
- Murder of Trayvon Martin in February 2012 that I started researching
- I had no idea that my whiteness would protect me from violence

IT DOESN'T MEAN that my life is easy or perfect because I'm white. 
IT MEANS certain forms of injustice and oppression will pass me by.

- Brings me to another form of privilege: the privilege of not needing to know or care
- "I don't really get involved in politics"
- "I don't want to talk about this, it's nothing to do with me"

I never knew about systemic racism and violence because I didn't need to.

---

@title[Oppression]

# Oppression 🔒

Note:

- hate crimes or discrimination are part of oppression
BUT
- systemic rather than personal 
- supported and enforced by society and its institutions
- could be so ubiquitous that it seems 'normal'

'OBVIOUS' example
- unable to get married or vote

LESS OBVIOUS example
- Employers discarding CV applications based on the applicant's name

Modern discrimination and bigotry are often quite subtle and difficult to prove.

An important thing to do as an ally is to BELIEVE PEOPLE.

ONE LAST THING
- Not about 'winning the oppression olympics'
- it's not about counting privilege/oppression and seeing who has the bigger number
- IMPORTANT for taking intersectional vectors into account

---

@title[Microaggressions]

# Microaggressions
# 😶😶😶😶😶😶😬😤😡

Note: 

- Brief, commonplace indignities or insults - intentional or otherwise.
- Small, subtle ways that a person is excluded, dismissed, alienated.

Analogy often used: MOSQUITO BITES. One or two are annoying ...

EXAMPLES
- Asking someone "where are you FROM?" because they're not white
- Casually using slurs or bigoted language in everyday conversation

"That's so gay"
"My boss is going to go mental"

- Not bothering to learn how to pronounce someone's name correctly
- Telling someone that their name is 'too hard' to learn
- Referring to someone by incorrect pronouns
- Casually using gender-exclusive language

"Hey guys" --> others women and non-binary people in the room

Literally addressing men --> guys is fine

Otherwise, perpetuates an exclusionary environment
- Opression = UBIQUITOUS, NORMAL

HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED someone seeming overly upset, angry, "hysterical" in relation to something that seemed harmless or not a big deal to you?

Consider that the 'tiny' thing you witnessed might have been one in a long line of microaggressions.

A common microaggression is to invalidate and dismiss the reactions and emotions expressed by a marginalised person.

@title[Intent vs Impact]

# Intent vs Impact
### If I Accidentally Punch You In the Face Did You Still Get Punched?
#### [Rebekah Hutson](https://www.onlyblackgirl.com/blog/intent-vs-impact)

Note: 

(READ THE QUOTE)

Understanding intent vs impact is important because intent is often used as an excuse or defense for microaggressions or discriminatory behaviour. 

- "I didn't mean it that way"
- "It was just a joke"
- "I never meant any harm"
- "I'm definitely not a racist/sexist/etc"

- Whether these defences are SINCERE OR NOT, 
- they CENTRE the person who caused the harm, 
- taking attention away from the person WHO WAS HARMED.

The impact of your actions matters more than what you intended.

ASSUMING GOOD INTENT
* broadly speaking this is ok
* if you suffer from anxiety or paranoia, this can help

HOWEVER
* be aware that this can be naive
* marginalised people may refuse to assume good intent because they can see contextual clues that you haven't noticed
* asking the victim of a microaggression to assume good intent places a mental and emotional burden on them

INSTEAD
* be aware of the impact of your actions
* hold yourself and others around you accountable

---

@title[Being an ally every day]

# Being an ally means
## helping to take on a tiny piece of the burden
### Avoid adding to the burden, passively or otherwise

Note: 

(READ THE SLIDE)

NOT ABOUT

* rescuing people
* being the saviour

IT's ABOUT

* ACTIVE support
* solidarity with marginalised groups

By shouldering some of the burden, allies ensure that 
marginalised groups aren't the only ones doing the work.

Having good intentions is not enough.

---

@title[Learn to centre others]

# Learn to centre others
### Don't make it all about you

Note:

This is tough, everyone has an ego.

* Important to observe your own behaviours and spot when you're centring yourself inappropriately

Includes:
* giving your opinions and advice unsolicited
* dismissing something if you haven't personally experienced it
* derailing discussions to talk about yourself 
* letting your ego get in the way of listening

"I can't be RACIST, I'm a GOOD person!"

---

@title[Get comfortable with discomfort]

# Get comfortable with being uncomfortable
### Heavy topics are uncomfortable, and that's ok

Note:

The nature of oppression and dealing with social injustice means it's inevitably not always going to be easy or cheerful. 

* There are times you will feel uncomfortable.
* Recognise that it's ok to feel uncomfortable sometimes. 
* Temporary emotional discomfort is not going to hurt you.

FLINCH RESPONSE
DEFENSIVE, LASH OUT

* "How dare you!!!"
* "I'm a GOOD PERSON!!!"
* "That can't be true! I don't believe you!"

Practise letting go of the emotional flinch.

DISCLAIMER
- emotional discomfort
- not actual danger or threat

---

@title[Avoid tone policing]

# Avoid tone policing 👮🚨

![Tone policing Greta Thunberg](https://i.imgur.com/nKk24JU.png)

Note:

(READ THE TWEET)

* I picked this tweet out because it's a USEFUL example

TONE POLICING
* invalidating someone's position based on HOW they said it
* dismissing someone because they expressed an emotion
* ignoring the substance of a message based on its presentation

EXAMPLES
* telling someone to calm down, chill out
* accusing someone of being too aggressive or angry
* telling someone they need to be more "CIVIL" or "POLITE"

IT'S NOT ABOUT
* saying whatever, however you want

"Because you didn't say it nicely, the way I want, I'm ignoring your point"
"People would be more likely to listen to you if you said it differently"

Marketing and presentation is a fact of life, so sometimes 
pragmatism is necessary with how messages are presented. But that doesn't make it ok to police someone else's tone.

Allyship shouldn't be conditional upon the message being comfortable for you.

(REFER BACK TO TWEET)

DISCLAIMER
* If someone's screaming at you or making you feel unsafe,
* it's ok to remove yourself from that situation. 
* That's not tone policing.

---

@title[Use inclusive language]

# Use inclusive language
### Normalise inclusion in the workplace

Note:

AS AN ALLY
* make an effort to use inclusive language
* ONE EXAMPLE: "everyone" instead of "guys"
* Do your research and try to make a habit of it

Normalising inclusive behaviours
* improves the work environment and culture for everyone

Language is a human construct and we can choose how we want it to develop.
* Choose to develop it in a way that includes everyone

DIVERSITY & INCLUSION
* is a phrase that gets used a lot in the context of tech and HR
* we don't often talk about the difference between diversity and inclusion
* inclusion is about making sure that we don't leave anyone behind 

---

@title[Apologise and move on from mistakes]

# Listen more
# Talk less
### Do your own research

Note:

* Talking less and listening more
* another way of centering others instead of yourself

* Learn from others
* Believe what they are telling you

* Consider broadening your media consumption 
* If you only ever hear voices like yours, you're going to miss out

IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS
* do the research yourself
* we all work in tech
* we know how to google things

Demanding "proof" and citations is exhausting and places
the burden of your education on the shoulders of the marginalised

---

@title[Apologise and move on from mistakes]

# What if I make a mistake???
# 😱

* Apologise sincerely
* Acknowledge the impact
* Move on 
* Do better next time

Note:

* Nobody is perfect
* Everyone makes mistakes
* Feeling guilty about mistakes is uncomfortable
* But still avoid making it all about you

APOLOGISE SINCERELY
* Don't do a fake apology "I'm sorry you felt that way"

ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPACT
* Demonstrate that you know what you're apologising for

MOVE ON 
* Don't drag the apology out
* Don't make it about you
* Don't get caught up in how bad you feel
* Don't expect the person you harmed to comfort you

DO BETTER NEXT TIME
* It's not ok to keep making the same mistakes
* Apologies won't fix everything or make it ok
* Learn from your experiences
* Don't beat yourself up but
* Hold yourself accountable

---

@title[Take care of yourself]

# Take care of yourself
### (This one is all about you)

Note:

WHEN WE SAY
* Don't make it all about you

IT DOESN'T MEAN
* It can never be about you

SELF CARE IS IMPORTANT
* avoid burn out and exhaustion
* helps you to support others

Everyone needs time to focus on themselves
* Appropriate time and place
* Friends, family, a therapist, your inner circle

HELPS TO AVOID CENTRING YOURSELF
* when interacting with marginalised groups

---

@title[Allyship: steps to get started]

# Allyship

1. talk less, listen more
2. google it yourself, do your research
3. avoid making it all about you
4. get comfortable with being uncomfortable
5. practise self-care

Note:

TO SUMMARISE

@title[This all sounds like a lot of work]

@snap[north span-100]
# Gosh
### This all sounds like a lot of work
@snapend

@snap[south span-100]
## Yup
# 🤷🏻
@snapend

Note:

* This has been quite a heavy talk
* Focusing on the negative aspects of humanity is draining
* It takes a lot of mental effort
* But it's worth being an ally so that the burden doesn't fall entirely on marginalised people

INTRO NEXT SLIDES
* Because research and learning is such a big part of being an ally,
* I've collated further reading links relating back to the subjects discussed.

I WILL POST A LINK
* to the talk slides in slack and over email
* so you can access the links

I'D LIKE TO FINISH
* with a quote from Rebekah Hutson
* from onlyblackgirl.com

"Marginalized people have been taking the full brute force of prejudice and discrimination on a worldwide scale for centuries and we’re tired. We’re tired and dying. If you truly believe in equity and human rights for everyone, you need to start doing the work to prove it."

THANK YOU
