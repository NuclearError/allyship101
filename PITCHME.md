@title[What is intersectionality?]

@snap[north span-100]
#### What is intersectionality?  
Everyone occupies different social and cultural 'spaces' (vectors) based on their differences, eg. age, race, class, gender, education etc.

Some types of difference will lead to societal disadvantages (**oppression**)

Some differences will lead to societal advantages (**privilege**)

@title[Privilege and Oppression]

@snap[north span-100]
#### Privilege and Oppression 

Privilege ...
* is the other side of oppression
* doesn't mean 'bad': it's not a comment on you as a person
* can be invisible: it is easy to be unaware of your own privileges

You can be both privileged and oppressed at the same time, in different ways
